# Optional native Amplifier adapter

Desktop Tasks is a portable skill. Its [primary guide](../README.md) installs only
the method and references; a host's existing computer-use tool can apply them.
This reference is for developers who separately need the retained Amplifier
`cua` bundle and `tool-cua` Python adapter. Those native names remain stable.

The instructions below are retained native setup and troubleshooting guidance.
They assume a compatible Amplifier CLI, its module-loading Python environment
and the selected platform backend. Check the installed CLI's help before using
historical commands or environment paths. Installing an adapter does not grant
OS access or establish successful operation in a real application.

Use the explicit `fixture` backend for a fake desktop. Use a real backend only
after the host has its required dependencies and OS permissions. Fixture tests
check action plumbing; they do not establish live desktop acceptance.

### amplifier-bundle-cua

Amplifier bundle for computer-use automation — universal desktop control, semantic UI understanding, and safe bounded operation.

**Bundle namespace:** `cua`  
**Git source:** `git+https://github.com/michaeljabbour/amplifier-skill-desktop-tasks@main`

---

## Overview

This bundle provides CUA (Computer-Use Automation) capabilities to the Amplifier CLI. It exposes:

- **Behaviors** — reusable context/skill layers (`cua-core`, `cua-operator`, `cua-recipes`)
- **Agents** — task-oriented agents (`cua-operator`, `cua-planner`)
- **Recipes** — multi-step automation workflows (`bounded-task`, `observe-and-act`, `recovery-workflow`)
- **Tool module** — `tool-cua` Python package (lives in `modules/tool-cua/`)

## Local development setup

Requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Python ≥ 3.11.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/michaeljabbour/amplifier-skill-desktop-tasks
cd amplifier-skill-desktop-tasks

# Install all dev dependencies (workspace-aware)
uv sync --group dev
```

---

## Automated tests

```bash
# Run full test suite (quiet)
uv run pytest tests/ -q

# Run with verbose output and short tracebacks
uv run pytest tests/ -v --tb=short

# Lint
uv run ruff check .

# Format check
uv run ruff format --check .

# Type check
uv run pyright
```

> **Important — exit code 0 does not prove `tool-cua` loaded.**
> Amplifier treats tool/module load failures as non-fatal and can complete a session successfully
> even if `tool-cua` never mounted. An exit code of 0 from `amplifier run` is **not** an
> authoritative signal that the module loaded or that the macOS fail-fast behaviour fired
> correctly.
>
> **Authoritative verification methods for this bundle's fail-fast behaviour:**
>
> 1. Run the registry tests directly:
>    ```bash
>    uv run pytest tests/test_registry.py -v
>    ```
> 2. Inspect stderr for Amplifier's module-load error line:
>    ```
>    Failed to load module 'tool-cua'
>    ```
>    If that line is absent, the module loaded (or the run never attempted to load it).

## Backend selection and provenance

`backend: auto` uses the native platform backend and raises an error when it
cannot initialize; it never silently substitutes the fixture. Request the
simulator explicitly with `backend: fixture` or `AMPLIFIER_CUA_BACKEND=fixture`.
Every action result identifies its `backend` and whether it was `simulated`.
Composite `observe` results retain each component's status: a partly available
snapshot is `ambiguous` with `partial: true`, while a wholly unavailable snapshot
is `failure` or `blocked`. Fixture success is evidence of simulated action only.

## Smoke test — local clone with fixture backend

The fixture backend runs without any real desktop/OS access, making it safe for CI and quick validation.

**1. Create a settings override file** in your project (or a scratch directory):

```yaml
# .amplifier/settings.local.yaml
modules:
  tools:
    - module: tool-cua
      config:
        backend: fixture
```

**2. Run Amplifier against the local bundle:**

```bash
# Use the file:// URI form — verified to work with the current CLI
export REPO=/absolute/path/to/amplifier-bundle-cua
amplifier run --bundle "file://$REPO" ...
```

> **Note — `file://` is required for local bundles.** CLI verification in this repo confirmed that  
> `file:///absolute/path/to/amplifier-bundle-cua` (i.e. `file://$REPO`) works correctly, while  
> bare path forms such as `/absolute/path/to/amplifier-bundle-cua` did **not** work.  
>
> **Note — `--set` not supported.** The current Amplifier CLI does **not** support a `--set` flag  
> for inline config overrides. Backend selection must be supplied via `.amplifier/settings.local.yaml`  
> (shown above) placed in your working directory or home config directory.

---

## Smoke test — GitHub source with fixture backend

Once the bundle is pushed to GitHub, you can load it directly:

```bash
amplifier run --bundle git+https://github.com/michaeljabbour/amplifier-skill-desktop-tasks@main ...
```

Use the same `.amplifier/settings.local.yaml` from the section above to activate the fixture backend:

```yaml
modules:
  tools:
    - module: tool-cua
      config:
        backend: fixture
```

This tells Amplifier to install the bundle from the GitHub source at `@main`, editable-install the root (no Python packages are auto-discovered thanks to the `[tool.setuptools] packages = []` override in `pyproject.toml`), and use the fixture backend for `tool-cua`.

---

## Notes / troubleshooting

### `No packages found` or `flat-layout` install error

If you see setuptools complaining about flat-layout auto-discovery when installing the repo root as an editable package, ensure `pyproject.toml` contains:

```toml
[tool.setuptools]
packages = []
```

This suppresses auto-discovery for the root package (the actual Python code lives in `modules/tool-cua/`, not the root).

### `--set` flag not recognised

The `--set` flag for inline config overrides is not supported by the current Amplifier CLI. Use `.amplifier/settings.local.yaml` instead (see smoke test sections above).

### Workspace member not found

If `uv sync` cannot resolve `tool-cua`, verify that `modules/tool-cua/pyproject.toml` exists and that `[tool.uv.workspace]` in the root `pyproject.toml` lists `"modules/tool-cua"` as a member.

### Running against a specific branch

Append `@<branch-or-sha>` to the git URL:

```bash
amplifier run --bundle git+https://github.com/michaeljabbour/amplifier-skill-desktop-tasks@my-branch ...
```

---

## macOS real backend requirements

The `auto` backend (and the default when no backend is configured) on macOS **fails fast** if the required pyobjc dependencies are missing — it will **not** silently fall back to fixture data. This makes misconfiguration immediately visible rather than producing confusing no-op behaviour.

### Install pyobjc dependencies

```bash
~/.local/share/uv/tools/amplifier/bin/python -m pip install \
  "pyobjc-framework-Quartz>=10.0" \
  "pyobjc-framework-ApplicationServices>=10.0"
```

### Grant Accessibility permission

Semantic tree access and all input actions (click, type, key press, scroll) require macOS Accessibility permission. Grant it in:

**System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**

Add the application or terminal that runs Amplifier.

### CI / testing without a real desktop

Use `backend: fixture` to get deterministic fake data without any OS dependencies:

```yaml
# .amplifier/settings.local.yaml
modules:
  tools:
    - module: tool-cua
      config:
        backend: fixture
```

`FixtureBackend` is always reachable through an explicit `backend: fixture` setting. The `auto` backend will **never** silently return fixture data — if the real backend cannot initialise on a recognised platform, it raises an actionable error pointing here.
